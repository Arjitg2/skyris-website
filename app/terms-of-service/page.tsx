- A standard upfront deposit (typically 50%) is required before any development work begins, unless stated otherwise in your custom proposal.

**Refund Policy:**
- We offer a "See it first, pay only if you love it" approach for our initial custom mockups.
- However, once a deposit is paid and the actual development or service implementation has commenced, the deposit is generally **non-refundable**, as it covers the time and labor invested by our team.
- Refunds for subsequent payments are handled on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of Clivik.`,

- A "revision" constitutes minor adjustments to text, colors, layout, or images within the agreed-upon design.
- Major changes that deviate significantly from the original approved mockup or scope (e.g., requesting a completely new design, adding complex e-commerce features not originally discussed) will be subject to additional fees.
- Once the final project is approved by the client, any subsequent changes will be billed at our standard hourly or fixed-task rate.`,
